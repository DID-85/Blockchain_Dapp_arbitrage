# Blockchain_Dapp_arbitrage



Description:
DexArbitrage is a Solidity smart contract designed to facilitate decentralized arbitrage trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) within the Ethereum blockchain. The contract aims to exploit price discrepancies between different DEXs to generate profits for users.

Features:

Arbitrage Trading: DexArbitrage enables users to perform arbitrage trading by executing trades across multiple DEXs to exploit price differentials.

Triple DEX Arbitrage: The contract supports triple DEX arbitrage, allowing users to capitalize on price disparities between three different tokens across three DEXs.

Optimized Trading Strategies: DexArbitrage implements optimized trading strategies to maximize profits while considering factors such as gas costs, slippage, and liquidity.

Threshold Management: The contract includes a threshold management mechanism to ensure sufficient liquidity or balances are maintained for executing trades effectively.

Owner Controls: Certain functions of the contract are accessible only by the contract owner, providing control over critical parameters and operations.

How to Use:

Deployment: Deploy the DexArbitrage smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
Configuration: Set the required parameters such as threshold values, trading balances, and API keys.
Initiate Arbitrage: Call the appropriate functions to start arbitrage trading or estimate potential profits from arbitrage opportunities.
Withdraw Funds: The contract owner can withdraw accumulated funds from successful trades.
Setup:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/username/DexArbitrage.git
Install dependencies: npm install
Deploy the smart contract using tools like Truffle or Remix IDE.
Configure the contract parameters according to your requirements.
Interact with the contract using Ethereum wallets or scripts.
